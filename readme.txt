Publishers use the Public Good plugin to “make the news actionable” which drives both reader engagement and incremental revenue. We pay media partners premium viewable CPMs between $4 - $8. We also offer opportunities to deliver campaigns that drive positive engagement for the publication and it's community at no charge.

Here’s how it works, the plugin embeds Public Good Action Units in content empowering readers to take action on what they just read about. Example actions include help hurricane victims, nominate a hero, learn more, pledge for change, write a message of hope, advocate, pledge, donate, etc. Brands and nonprofits sponsor these units to drive awareness and engagement in their purpose and social impact work.
